# Use the pre-built image

The Mock Register image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/consumerdataright/mock-register).

There are a number of ways that this image can be used.

## Pull the Mock Register image from Docker Hub

Run the following command to pull the latest image from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull consumerdataright/mock-register
```

You can also pull a specific image by supplying a tag, such as the name of the branch ("main" or "develop") or a release number:

```
# Pull the image from the main branch
docker pull consumerdataright/mock-register:main

# Pull the 0.5.0 version of the image
docker pull consumerdataright/mock-register:0.5.0
```

## Run the Mock Register

The Mock Register relies on SQL Server for data persistence so the container has a dependency on the SQL Server container image provided by Microsoft.

In order to run the Mock Register and related SQL Server instance, use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

```
# Navigate to the Source directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
cd .\Source

# Run the Mock Register and SQL Server containers.
docker-compose up -d

# When finished, stop the containers.
docker-compose down
```

### Note: EULA for SQL Server
The `docker-compose.yml` file utilises the Microsoft SQL Server Image from Docker Hub. The Microsoft EULA for the Microsoft SQL Server Image must be accepted to continue.
Set the `ACCEPT_EULA` environment variable to `Y` within the `docker-compose.yml` if you accept the EULA.
See the [Microsoft SQL Server Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) on Docker Hub for more information.

Example of accepting the `ACCEPT_EULA` environment variable of the SQL Server container.
```
  mssql:
    container_name: sql1
    image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest'
    ports:
      - '1433:1433'
    environment:
      - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
```

### Note: Mock Register host name
By default, the Mock Register will run using a host name of `mock-register`.  

When running locally, to resolve the `mock-register` host name, an entry can be added to the `hosts` file of the local machine.
```
127.0.0.1   mock-register
```

## Run a multi-container Mock CDR Ecosystem

Multiple containers can be run concurrently to simulate a CDR ecosystem.  The [Mock Register](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-register), [Mock Data Holder](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-holder), [Mock Data Holder Energy](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-holder-energy) and [Mock Data Recipient](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-recipient) containers can be run by using the `docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml` file.

```
# Navigate to the Source directory where the docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml file is located.
cd .\Source

# Run the Mock and SQL Server containers.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml up -d

# When finished, stop the containers.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml down
```

### Note: EULA for SQL Server
Like the `docker-compose.yml` file, the `docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml` file also requires acceptance of the EULA for the SQL Server image.

### Note: Mock host names

Each Mock solution has a default host name, as per below:

| Mock solution           | Default host name       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mock Register           | mock-register           |
| Mock Data Holder        | mock-data-holder        |
| Mock Data Holder Energy | mock-data-holder-energy |
| Mock Data Recipient     | mock-data-recipient     |

If running locally, each of these host names can be registered in the local machine's `host` file:

```
127.0.0.1   mock-register
127.0.0.1   mock-data-holder
127.0.0.1   mock-data-holder-energy
127.0.0.1   mock-data-recipient
```

## Changing the host names of the mock solutions

The host names used in the mock solutions can be changed by overriding environment variables in each container.  

For example, making the following changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file will set the host name for the Mock Register to `localhost`:

```
  mock-register:
    container_name: mock-register
    image: consumerdataright/mock-register
    ports: 
      - "7000:7000"
      - "7001:7001"
      - "7006:7006"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Release
      - IssuerUri=https://localhost:7000/idp
      - JwksUri=https://localhost:7000/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks
      - TokenUri=https://localhost:7001/idp/connect/token
      - IdentityServerTokenUri=https://localhost:7001/idp/connect/token
      - IdentityServerUrl=https://localhost:7000/idp
      - IdentityServerIssuer=https://localhost:7000/idp
```

Similar environment variables can be set in the `docker-compose.Ecosystem.yml` file to set the host names of the other mock solutions.

The environment variables for each mock solution that require setting in order to update the host names are as follows:

| Mock solution           | Environment Variable    | Default Value |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Mock Register           | IssuerUri               | https://localhost:7000/idp |
| Mock Register           | JwksUri                 | https://localhost:7000/idp/.well-known/openid-configuration/jwks |
| Mock Register           | TokenUri                | https://localhost:7001/idp/connect/token |
| Mock Register           | IdentityServerTokenUri  | https://localhost:7001/idp/connect/token |
| Mock Register           | IdentityServerUrl       | https://localhost:7000/idp |

### Note: Update Mock Register data
If the host names are changed, then the data stored in the Mock Register should be updated to reflect the updated mock solution endpoints.

This can be achieved by using the Admin API, as outlined in the solution README.

## Host on your own infrastructure
The mock solutions can also be hosted on your own infrastructure, such as virtual machines or kubernetes clusters, in your private data centre or in the public cloud.
